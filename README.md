# PyMaze

This is a simple depth-first search maze generator and solver written in python and based on the [Mazeworks](http://www.mazeworks.com/mazegen/mazetut/index.htm) tutorial.

# Dependencies

* __Python__ - http://www.python.org/download/

# Background

I wrote this generator both as a means to investigate maze generation algorithms as well as to refresh my knowledge of python. As such this code base is still very rough but it has served as a valuable learning exercise.
